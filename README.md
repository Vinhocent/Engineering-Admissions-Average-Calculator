# Engineering Admissions Average Calculator
Average Calculator

In the midst of the admissions process and reddit/admissions thread scrolling, I decided to take my mind off admissions by creating a script to calculate my average for my desired programs :))

Input your desired average and your top 6 marks to figure out your average and how many net marks you need to gain to get your desired average.
